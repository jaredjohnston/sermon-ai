# Concurrent Audio Extraction Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers testing the concurrent audio extraction feature that enables immediate transcription while video uploads continue in the background.

## Feature Summary

**Problem Solved:** Large sermon videos (4GB-40GB) took 45+ minutes to upload before transcription could begin.

**Solution:** Extract audio concurrently with video upload, start transcription immediately from audio, continue video upload in background.

**Expected Outcome:** 60% faster transcript access (25 minutes vs 45+ minutes) for content creation.

## Testing Strategy

### Core Functionality Focus
- **Does it work?** (not "is it faster?")
- **Does error handling work?**
- **Does cleanup work?**
- **Does the flow match requirements?**

## Test Suite Structure

### 1. End-to-End Testing (`run_quick_test.py`)

**Purpose:** Verify complete user workflow with concurrent processing

**Key Verifications:**
```bash
python run_quick_test.py
```

**What it tests:**
- User registration ‚Üí Concurrent upload ‚Üí Transcription ‚Üí Callback ‚Üí Cleanup
- Response structure indicates concurrent processing
- Audio extraction completed before response
- Video upload marked as "background_processing"
- Audio cleanup after successful transcription

**Success Indicators:**
```
‚úÖ PASS Concurrent Upload + Audio Extraction
‚úÖ PASS Callback + Audio Cleanup
üéâ ALL TESTS PASSED! Complete concurrent audio extraction flow working!
```

### 2. Unit Tests (`test_audio_extraction_service.py`)

**Purpose:** Test audio extraction service in isolation

```bash
pytest tests/test_audio_extraction_service.py -v
```

**Core Functions Tested:**
- `extract_and_upload_audio()` - Main extraction workflow
- `cleanup_audio_file()` - Storage cleanup
- `_run_ffmpeg_extraction()` - FFmpeg parameters
- Error handling and stream management

**Key Test Cases:**
```python
test_extract_audio_from_small_file()        # Basic functionality
test_ffmpeg_extraction_error_handling()     # Graceful failures
test_supabase_upload_error_handling()       # Upload failures
test_stream_position_reset()                # Video reuse
test_cleanup_audio_file_success()           # Storage cleanup
test_ffmpeg_command_parameters()            # Deepgram optimization
```

### 3. Integration Tests (`test_concurrent_upload_flow.py`)

**Purpose:** Test concurrent processing flow and error scenarios

```bash
pytest tests/test_concurrent_upload_flow.py -v
```

**Critical Flow Tests:**
```python
test_transcription_starts_immediately_not_waiting_for_video()  # Key requirement
test_audio_extraction_failure_cancels_video_upload()          # Complete failure
test_background_video_upload_independence()                   # Fire-and-forget
test_callback_audio_cleanup_integration()                     # End-to-end cleanup
test_concurrent_flow_response_structure()                     # API contract
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario A: Happy Path (Test with test_audio.mp4)
```
1. Upload test_audio.mp4 video file (~44MB)
2. ‚úÖ Audio extracted and uploaded immediately
3. ‚úÖ Transcription starts from audio
4. ‚úÖ Response returned quickly
5. ‚úÖ Video upload continues in background
6. ‚úÖ Transcript ready shortly after
7. ‚úÖ Audio file cleaned up after completion
```

**Note:** Using `test_audio.mp4` provides faster testing while demonstrating the same concurrent processing functionality as larger files.

### Scenario B: Audio Extraction Failure
```
1. Upload corrupted video file
2. ‚ùå Audio extraction fails
3. ‚úÖ Video upload task cancelled
4. ‚úÖ Complete failure response to user
5. ‚úÖ No partial success state
```

### Scenario C: Error Recovery
```
1. Upload valid video
2. ‚úÖ Audio extracted successfully
3. ‚úÖ Transcription starts
4. ‚ùå Video upload fails (network issue)
5. ‚úÖ Transcription continues (independent)
6. ‚úÖ User gets transcript despite video failure
```

## Response Verification

### Expected Upload Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Audio extracted and transcription started immediately. Video upload continues in background.",
  "processing_info": {
    "audio_extracted": true,
    "transcription_started": true,
    "video_upload_status": "background_processing"
  },
  "next_steps": {
    "description": "Transcription processing from extracted audio (faster than full video)",
    "estimated_time": "~6 minutes"
  }
}
```

### Key Response Indicators
- ‚úÖ Message mentions "Audio extracted" and "transcription started immediately"
- ‚úÖ `processing_info.audio_extracted = true`
- ‚úÖ `processing_info.transcription_started = true`
- ‚úÖ `processing_info.video_upload_status = "background_processing"`
- ‚úÖ Description mentions "extracted audio"

## Audio Cleanup Verification

### Callback Processing
```json
POST /api/v1/transcription/callback
{
  "metadata": {"request_id": "deepgram-123"},
  "results": {"channels": [{"alternatives": [{"transcript": "..."}]}]}
}
```

### Expected Cleanup Logs
```
‚úÖ Transcript updated successfully - Status: completed
üßπ Cleaned up audio file: clients/{client_id}/audio/audio_{video_id}_{hash}.wav
```

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] Test video file available (use `test_audio.mp4` - ~44MB, faster for testing)
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Supabase storage accessible
- [ ] Deepgram API key valid

**Note:** `test_audio.mp4` is perfect for testing as it's large enough to trigger TUS resumable upload (>6MB threshold) while being small enough for fast testing cycles.

### Test Execution
- [ ] Run `python run_quick_test.py`
- [ ] Verify concurrent processing response structure
- [ ] Check logs for audio extraction and upload
- [ ] Verify transcription starts immediately
- [ ] Simulate callback and verify cleanup

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Upload response indicates concurrent processing
- [ ] Transcription request_id returned immediately
- [ ] Video upload continues in background
- [ ] Audio file cleaned up after transcription
- [ ] No orphaned temporary files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Audio extraction fails:**
- Check FFmpeg installation: `ffmpeg -version`
- Verify test_audio.mp4 file exists and has audio stream
- Check temporary directory permissions

**Upload response doesn't show concurrent processing:**
- Verify audio extraction service import
- Check for exceptions in upload endpoint
- Review logs for service initialization

**Audio cleanup doesn't work:**
- Check Supabase storage permissions
- Verify metadata storage in transcript record
- Review callback logs for cleanup attempts

**Tests fail with mocking errors:**
- Ensure all async functions properly mocked
- Check patch decorators target correct modules
- Verify mock return values match expected types

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check service imports
python -c "from app.services.audio_extraction_service import audio_extraction_service; print('OK')"

# Test FFmpeg availability
ffmpeg -version

# Run specific test with verbose output
pytest tests/test_concurrent_upload_flow.py::TestConcurrentUploadFlow::test_transcription_starts_immediately_not_waiting_for_video -v -s

# Run tests with full traceback
pytest tests/ -v --tb=long
```

## Performance Notes

**What we DON'T test:**
- Timing comparisons (audio vs video speed)
- Performance benchmarks
- Multiple concurrent uploads

**Focus:** Functional verification only - does the concurrent flow work as designed?
