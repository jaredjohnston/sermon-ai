Please find your seats. The service will begin in four minutes. Welcome to Soul Church. Please find your seats. The service will begin in three minutes. Welcome the of in the the of church. We are We Lord. The the God of the impossible. Are you happy to be in the house of God this morning, church? Yes. Have you come expecting? Come on. We're in for a treat today. Got Canon J John with us and he's gonna bring the word very soon. It's gonna be incredible. Whether you're new or visiting today, whether you're joining us online or whether you come every week, I wanna encourage you in this moment. Let this be our humble worship before our king of kings and our lord of lords. He reigns on high. He is so good. He is so good to each and every one of us. It says this in Psalm a 107, give thanks to the Lord for he is good. For he is what? He is good. He is good. He is good. His faithful love endures forever. Has the Lord redeemed you? Then speak out. Tell others that he has redeemed you. It goes on to say, for he has gathered the exiles from many lands, from east and west and north to south. Says he led them straight to safety to a city where they could live. So let them praise the Lord for his great love and for the wonderful things that he has done for them, for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things. And whether you've come from east, south, north, or West this morning, how beautiful that we get to come together and worship our King of Kings and our Lord of Lords together sanctuary, in this church, as a community of believers. So come on, why don't we pray together? Heavenly Father, we welcome you. We welcome your presence. We welcome your Holy Spirit. It is already here and moving amongst us. We pray that you would move in our worship this morning. We offer you the highest praise, the highest glory. It's yours forever. It's yours forever. All the different ways we see you and all the ways you move, all the colors and expressions, all the beauty of your church. What a masterful reflection when we are unified, bride. We sing praise. Oh, praise the father and praise the son. Holy Spirit, make us one every nation. Every miracle we've seen. It's a glimpse of what is coming. So by faith, help us believe. Amen? And we know we will see holy, cry. Come on. You sing to him. Holy We is the lamb. Holy is the lamb. We cry holy, holy, holy. And we Amen. Yesterday morning, my son woke up really early. And so what do you do when your kids get you up early? You get them in the car, try and get them back to sleep. So, about 07:00 yesterday morning, I'm driving down to Breadsauce in the city. I'm sat in the car park trying to get my son off to sleep and ten minutes is going by, fifteen minutes is going by and got some music on and eventually, he falls asleep and I'm about to go to get a coffee. And it's a really quiet Saturday morning, 07:45. And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, there'd been one one or two people coming to get their fresh bread in the morning. Car after car after car comes zooming around the corner into the car park. And I'm sitting there watching this like, this is extraordinary. One, two, three, four, five, ten, fifteen, twenty cars. And out jump from each of the cars, a guy, I assume part of a football team and no word of a lie church, they all sprint to the bakery. They get out of where they're parked and they sprint. And it was absolutely extraordinary. I couldn't believe my eyes. And in that moment, I sensed God nudge me and give me a prayer for today. Who is it that is gonna come urgently and with expectation to the house of the Lord this morning? Who is it that's gonna come in and run to the altar and to the house of the Lord and throw up their hands and say, God, things might be tough about right now, but nothing is gonna stop me from getting to your house this morning. Nothing is gonna stop me from lifting up the name of Jesus. Proverbs 18 verse 10 says, the name of the Lord is a strong tower. The righteous, they run. They run to it, they are safe. Who's with me this morning? We're gonna sing that again. All hail, king Jesus. Maybe you're about to go into exam periods. A levels, GCSEs. Maybe there's a conflict or something at work that is holding you back, concerning and consuming your mind this morning. Come on, everyone in this place. Nothing is gonna hold us back from lifting up the name of Jesus in the room, online. Come on, every hand, every voice. Let's lift his name. Come on church. Let's pray together. Heavenly father, here in the room and online, we want to acknowledge the presence of Jesus is in this place. Lord, we want to say to you today that nothing is gonna hold us back from opening our hearts, from lifting our hands, from confessing in faith that you are Lord. You are Lord. We are not Lord. We trust you. We depend on you. Whatever the situations that we face, health diagnosis, challenges in business, kids that are far away from you, whatever it is, Lord, we commit it into your hands, and we say, let the name of the Lord be a strong tower this morning. And as your people, Lord, we run to your presence. Lord, I thank you for every man, woman, child in this place and joining digitally in our online community. Lord, I pray you'd speak to hearts. You would change lives, that there would be salvation in the house this morning. And we all said in unison, amen. Amen. Come on. Let's lift up and praise to God. Fantastic. So good. So good to see everybody here today. A huge We're going the to presence presence of of God. God. My name is Matt. If I haven't had the chance to meet you, I'm one of the team here. It's a huge honor to have you in church this morning. I love that church is about coming and bringing God our praise, but it's also a place of celebration. Wouldn't you agree? You get to hear good reports and your faith is stirred. And so we've got a couple of things we quickly wanna celebrate because we've got our soul strikers, some of our young people who play in the football team. Come on, guys. Come on. Run up on the platform. Look at this. So the look at these guys. We've got a couple of teams in our youth and in our kids ministry that are called Soul Strikers, and some of the some of the team the the under fourteens, they won the league yesterday. It's so good. So come on. Come on, guys. Lift up your medals. Show us those medals, those shiny medals. Come on. Give them a hand. Well done, guys. Well done. Come on. Come on. Thank you, guys. And then we've got a young man in our church, Jack Pacini. Come on up here, Jack. Jack, tell us what you did last Sunday. I ran a marathon for Soul Shift. You ran a marathon for Soul Shift. Now I understand that Soul Shift played a big part in your story last year. And so how much have you raised towards young people going to Soul Shift this summer? I've raised over Â£750 for Soul Shift. Wow. Wow. How good is that? I just I was just chatting with Jimmy this morning. All of Jack's efforts and if you've done any running, you know that marathon is no small thing. All of Jack's efforts are going towards sponsoring other young people and so, from what you've raised, what I understand, there's, that's the equivalent to nine young people that can go to this summer's soul shift. So, come on. Why don't we give it up for Jack? Super. Great achievement. Brilliant. Well, a huge welcome to all of you in church. If this is your church, you're part of our church family at Soul. A big warm welcome to you but also we wanna recognize and acknowledge, are you a guest? Are you a visitor? Are you here for the first time? Would you be as confident to lift your hands, say, yeah, I'm here for the first time today. Come on, church. Let's warmly welcome everybody here this morning. And if you're joining online for the really a bumper weekend in the life of our church with our international Sunday. Give me a wave if you came out for international Sunday last weekend. Wasn't it terrific? Why you should brought an amazing word. Don't forget your three of you are listening. That's alright. It was a brilliant word. We had food vendors. There was lots of fellowship. It was a powerful service. We had Wotota with us. So cast your eyes to the screen. We've got a short highlights video, and then we're gonna celebrate a few things that happened at International Sunday. Yes. It was a brilliant weekend. We had almost 3,000 people here last weekend. I know the team connected with almost a 100 people who were visiting and guests for the first time. There were 58 nations represented last Sunday in church. And so it was such a celebration of the unity and the diversity of the church. But in particular, I wanna mention Wototo. And how We praise God for all that God is doing. Young people, you guys are gonna head to your program this morning. So come on, why don't we give them a hand? It's great to see all of our young people here in church leading the way down the front. God, some of you are a bit slow getting up there off the floor. Come on. Awesome. You guys have a great morning together. If you're a young family or you got a little one with you, then please, we've got our feeding room and some family rooms that our team would love to to direct you to if your little one gets a bit restless. So, please know that this facility is available for you. We love seeing you here in church. I bring love from Pastor John and Chantel. They are traveling this weekend. It's actually the first time in three months that Pastor John is able to travel because of his eye and the treatment and the surgery that he had. And so Pastor John is in Sweden and Chantel is in an equally exotic place, Chesterfield, ministering at a women's conference, which is great. So they send their love. They'll be back next weekend, and John will be speaking on holy habits next Sunday. So definitely not one to miss. But we're really, really blessed and privileged this morning church to have Canon J. John and his wife, Killy, with us. If you've heard Canon J. John speak before, you know that he just has such a mandate, such an anointing to speak the gospel in an accessible way and has impacted millions and so, they they they're well known, such a legacy of speaking the gospel but they're friends of the house, they're friends of Soul Church. It's just over a year since they were with us for Easter and so it is so wonderful to have you back. Would you join me and stand in the room and online? And let's give a warm welcome to Kellen, Jay John, and Killy. Thank you. Thank you. Please take your seats. Oh, Melody and the angels. Honestly, I'm gonna call you Melody and the Angels. Thank you so much for tuning us into the Melody of Heaven. Thank you. There you are. Time out. You can have a tea break. Good morning. Isn't it great? It's so great. It's wonderful to be with you all. There's a lot of energy. We love it. Absolutely love it. Really is great to be here. You're just gonna mention a couple of books. Just gonna really quickly mention a few books. That's a good question. A book for children that just answers some of those questions that children ask, Where's heaven? And, Were there dinosaurs on the ark? So, important questions. Does Jesus fit into my heart? That And sort of in fact, children sent me these questions. I asked 10 children to send me their questions, and I chose 30 of them. And I really love writing this. You know, adults, we say to children, grow up. But Jesus said to adults, unless you become like little children. Yeah. And actually, adults love this book because they understand the answers. It's true. It's true. For preschool children and actually early readers, Knowing God, great little book, just introducing children to Jesus, and then how can I pray another little book based on the Lord's prayer for children, just helping them with prayer? And you know, sometimes you may not need a book like this, but buy it and give it to someone else. We've given 3,000 of these away to children's hospices. And you know, just give them away. Give them away and see what happens. See what happens. This book is called Will I be fat in heaven? You know, I'm at the age where I've got furniture disease. Do you know furniture disease? That's when your chest falls into your drawers. And I was wondering, what am I gonna look like in heaven? So that's one of 39 questions, but there are many other questions. Why do bad things happen to good people? And all sorts of questions like that. And the trinity, how can we believe in the trinity? How does that work? Because sometimes like, do we believe in three gods, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Someone said that to me recently, you believe in three gods. I said, no, we don't. We believe in one god. He goes, no, there are three gods. And I said, your mathematics is wrong. You're going one plus one plus one equals three, whereas I go one times one times one equals one. You know? So if you, you know, if you wanna learn how do you answer these questions, you might look at that. This is called Walking with God, 40 readings, five minutes a day. And that might be a little bite sized to encourage you in your journey of faith. I'm releasing a new podcast next Friday. The reason I'm mentioning it is it's called the J John Tom Wright podcast, and it's not really about J John. I'm interviewing this guy called Tom Wright, who's considered to be one of the most influential theologians in the world today, And I've recorded 12 programs, and honestly, his insights on the Bible, on Jesus, on Christianity, blew me away. And we're gonna release one a week, So you might like to listen to that once a week. That'll help you in your journey of faith. Killy, you're gonna read the bible. I am. I'm going to read from John chapter 11. Jesus arrived at the tomb, a cave with a stone rolled across its entrance. Roll the stone aside, Jesus told them. But Martha, the dead man's sister protested, Lord, he has been dead for four days. The smell will be terrible. Jesus responded, didn't I tell you that you would see God's glory if you believe? So they rolled the stone aside. Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, father, thank you for hearing me. You always hear me, but I said it out loud for the sake of all these people standing here so that they will believe you sent me. Then Jesus shouted, Lazarus, come out. And the dead man came out, his hands and feet bound in grave clothes, his face wrapped in a head cloth. Jesus told them, unwrap him and let him go. Many of the people who were with Mary believed in Jesus when they saw this happen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Killing. Jesus thank you. Jesus specializes in raising the dead. Have you fallen asleep? He's very good at waking people up who've fallen asleep. You know there are many walking dead people that need to be woken up by Jesus. And I'd like to draw out of this particular story, an encounter between Jesus and Lazarus and and the family. I'd like to draw out four words from this story. And the first word I want to draw out is remove. What's the first word? Remove. Jesus says, remove the stone. Now here's my question. Is there a stone standing between you and Jesus? Have you built a pile of stones between you and Jesus? Is there a stone standing between you and a miracle? We want breakthrough. Many of us desire breakthrough. Don't you desire breakthrough? You want, I want a breakthrough. I really want a breakthrough in my life or in this area, but you know, a breakthrough will not come if we have built a barrier. Now, what's the biggest barrier between us and Jesus? Shall I tell you? Are you ready for this? Well, first of all, what do you think? Ask yourself and answer it before I give you the answer. What do you think is the biggest barrier between most of us and Jesus? Try and answer that question. Okay, shall I tell you what the answer is? Unforgiveness. Unforgiveness is the biggest barrier between us and Jesus. It is the biggest stone that prevents us from encountering Jesus. So let's be honest. Do you have a grudge against somebody? If you have a grudge against somebody, you are not allowed to take holy communion. Don't take holy communion the next time it's offered to you because you're not allowed to. Do you have unforgiveness against anybody? If you do, you cannot take holy communion. You are forbidden to take it. When did you last hear that? You see, we don't take it seriously. Unforgiveness is toxic. Unforgiveness is like me drinking poison and hoping it will hurt the other person. What? That doesn't make sense. If I drink poison, how is it going to help the other person? How's it gonna harm them? It's not gonna harm them, it's gonna harm me. If you and I do not forgive, we break the bridge on which we must cross. We pray in the Lord's prayer these words, forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have sinned against us. So let me ask you again, is there unforgiveness in your heart? Are you holding a grudge? Are you holding bitterness against somebody? If you are, if you are, that is sin. Repent. And Romans, in the book of Romans we read this, as much as it lies within you, keep the peace. Now I'm Greek. Okay, so now you can all say, you know a little Greek. You know when the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding came out? Yeah, was a very popular movie. Friends of mine said, John, is that what Greek culture is like? I said, no. No, it's worse. It's very intense. It's very suffocating. My mother is a travel agent for guilt trips. Yeah? If I ring my mother, within one minute, she's making me feel guilty about something. I mean, it's unbelievable. She's going on about my hair at the moment, that I'm using the wrong shampoo, that's why it's falling out. And I'm like, well okay, well buy me the right shampoo. Listen, I phone my mother every week. Once a week, every week. Why? Because Jesus tells me to. You're going, well where does Jesus tell you in the bible to ring your mother? Well, he tells me to honor my mother and father. He also told me, as much as it lies within me, keep the peace. I ring my mother every week. It doesn't matter what she says to me. It matters how I respond to her. That's the most important thing. My mother lives in Cyprus. Go Kelly and I go every year to visit her. Why? Because she's my mother. Do I like her? No. I don't. His, do I love her? Yes. Yes. Yeah. So the reason it the reason I told you that's that is so that you know, oh, Jay John, he's got no issues with nobody, doesn't know anything. No, I'm telling you from experience. Listen, if you've been holding a grunge, a grudge or resentment, or bitterness, unforgiveness, particularly to a sibling, I know siblings who won't talk to each other, to parents. Do you know what you should do? Pick up the phone today. Pick up the phone today and say, I'm sorry for the way I've been treating you. Just do it. Shatter your pride. Humble yourself. If you really want to experience God, then you've got to remove the barriers. And if you remove the barriers, there could be a miracle. There could be a miracle. Remove. Remove our next door neighbors, not Christians, they call Killy and I the neighbors from heaven. That's quite nice actually, isn't it? And the lady had a stroke. And as a consequence of the stroke, she fell into a coma. She got transferred from our local hospital, ten minutes away, to a very renowned hospital called the John Ratcliffe in Oxford. The daughter came and spoke to Killy and said, we've just met with the consultant and the doctors, and they have said there's no brain activity. She's brain dead. So she's on a life support machine, and we've decided after five days, we're gonna turn it off so she dies. So so that five days, the family can go and visit. Achilles says, can my husband and I visit her? And the daughter said, please would you visit my mother because she was so fond of you. The only day I could go was the fifth day. So now we're driving to Oxford, and I do have to confess I was in a bit of a bad mood. Unacceptable, unacceptable for a Christian, let alone a reverend, unacceptable. And the thing was, I was moaning. I can't believe it. We could have been there in ten minutes. Now we've got a drive to Oxford. It's like, Oh no! Anyway, that doesn't really help, does it? Bad attitude. And I didn't know what was in my head. I was thinking, oh, go and see her, she can die. You know? No, that's what I was thinking. So we arrive, she's in this private room, we walk into the room and I said, Hello Joyce. I said, It's the neighbors from heaven. I said, We're gonna pray Joyce, that's what we're gonna do. So I'm talking to her, we're gonna pray, so she's got tubes everywhere, I get her hand, I hold Killy's hand, Killy holds her other hand, and I'm going Joyce, let's pray now the Lord's prayer. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. When we said your kingdom come, she woke up. Killy wet herself. I mean, it was like this. It was like this. Anyway, we went back home. I said to her husband, she woke up. He goes, no she didn't. I said, well she did. He goes, no she didn't. I said, she did. He goes, she didn't. I said, she did. Anyway, she came back ten days later. Now, why do I tell you that story? Well, listen, you know, he didn't tell us to go and raise her from the dead. He just basically said, move a stone. Move a little stone. Move a stone and I might end up doing a miracle. Listen, let's move the stones and see what God will do. I encourage you, if you've got a grudge, resentment, bitterness against a sibling, maybe someone that used to be a great friend, or your parents, and honestly, it's not like I want you to feel guilty, but I want you liberated, and look, do it today, do it within twenty four hours, Restore that relationship and do not hold a grudge. Do not hold bitterness. Do not hold unforgiveness and just enjoy what God's going to do because of that. The first word is remove. Remove. Okay, here's the second word. Jesus shouts out in a loud voice, Lazarus, come out. Now if you know anything about Jesus, it's a good job Jesus used the word Lazarus. If he hadn't used the word Lazarus and said come out, I can tell you this, everyone would have come out. Everybody would have come out. That's the power of Jesus' name. But on this occasion it was Lazarus come out. Here is my second word. Respond. Second word? Respond. First word? Believe. Second word? Spoiled. Okay. Here's the question. Have you done what Jesus has asked you to do? I get people coming up to me and go, oh, J John, could you give me a little bit of advice? I'm a bit of a crossroads in my life and, you know, I wanna hear what God's gonna say. And I say to them, has God told you to do something in the past but you haven't done it? Nine times out of 10 they go yes. I said, well why are you asking for further directions? Why are you asking for more, hey Jesus, what shall I do? Because Jesus will say, well I've told you to do x y z, you haven't done it. Why haven't you done X, Y and Z? You do X, Y and Z and I'll tell you what else to do. You see, constantly ignoring the past. Do it! We were in our church. Our pastor got up, and he goes, I'm really sorry to bring this to the attention of the church in a church service, but we are desperate, desperate for more people to volunteer for coffee. Sign up for the coffee rotor. And I'm thinking, what kind of a church is this? Why don't people volunteer? As I thought that, I get a quiver in my liver. You know that conviction, it kind of like like that. So I turned around and looked at the man behind me. He's like looking at me going why are you looking at me? Because I thought maybe the word went out from the stage and it went through, but you know when you're sitting sometimes you lean over. And I thought, well maybe I leaned over and I got the conviction, but the conviction was for the man behind me. And the next half an hour I'm going Lord, Lord, I'm not a barista. I'm not a barista. Oh Lord, don't make me do this. I don't wanna do it. Anyway, end of the service, Killy goes, what is wrong with you? You fidgeted the whole service. I said, oh, Killy, I think God wants you and me to sign up for coffee. Killy said, do you think I'm stupid? I said, no. I don't. I don't. She says, wants you to sign up for coffee. I said, oh, you can't let me do it on my own. So then the two of us go to sign up with the lady, and as soon as the lady saw us, she starts laughing. She says, you're not coming to sign up. I said, yes, we are. She goes, you're never here. I said, well that's not true. I said, three weekends a month, we go to other places, other churches, today we're here, last Sunday we were preaching in Portugal, but one Sunday a month we're always in church, in our church attending. So I said, how about we serve coffee once a month? So she goes, alright then, I'll sign you up once a month. Anyway, we had to arrive early. Like really early. Anyway, we did it, we did the whole thing, and I said to Keely, I don't like the coffee. It's really naff coffee. So then we bought our own coffee, and I didn't like the cups that they were served in, because you kind of burnt your fingers, so we bought cups. And I didn't like the biscuits they were serving, so we bought fresh cookies. And I didn't like it that they didn't serve napkins. How can you have a cookie and not have a napkin? So we bought nice napkins. So we started to invest in this ministry personally. Loved it. Loved it. I met more people, engaged with more people in three years than I ever did seventeen years previously. Right, after three years I felt the Lord say, that's it, you've done it. And I said, no, I like being a barista. I want to be a barista. Let me be a barista. He said, no. And I knew the Lord said, the Lord guides our steps and he guides our stops. And sometimes you have to stop something so that you can step into something. I was doing a mission in Belfast, in Bangor, and this guy wrote to me and said, hey J. John, I'm an evangelist, you're gonna be in Banga, please can I see you? And I said, oh okay, so he meets me, and he says, I'm an evangelist. I said, great, great, great. Goes, but I'm a fireman. I said, oh that's good, good, good. And he said, but I really believe God wants me to give up being a fireman and being a full time evangelist. I said, oh good, great, great, great. He said, oh you don't understand J. John. I said, what's that? He goes, well look, I'm married, I've got two small children, I've got a salary and I've got a pension. If I leave now, I'll lose my pension and then I won't have a salary. I said, what's the problem? He goes, what do you mean what's the problem? How am I going to survive financially? I said just do what God's telling you to do. As I said that, I kind of had this thought, look, what's your salary? He tells me. I said, you only need 10 people to give you this amount of money for one year, then you've got your one year salary. As I said that, I thought the Lord say, give him the first tenth. Now I know women don't think we can multitask, but I'm talking to him and I'm talking to God. And to the Lord I said, I don't want to. I just met the guy. I'm always giving money away. I'm always giving stuff away. I don't want to give him. I don't want to. And then there's like a few seconds, why on earth am I arguing with God? Because I'm gonna be absolutely miserable if I don't do what God tells me to do. I know I'm gonna be miserable. So I said to him, right, okay, I'm gonna be the first person to give you the first tenth. He starts crying, he's just weeping, and he can't believe it. I said, if you don't become a full time evangelist, you give it back to me. Okay, that guy, you can Google him, he goes by one name, Mitch. He is the most influential evangelist in Northern Ireland, in Southern Ireland. He now employs 35 full time people. It was me. It was me. I did it. I sowed the seed. Doesn't it feel good when you get it right? You know, last year, we had two cars, and I said to Killy, Listen, we don't need two cars. We don't need two cars, one's enough. I said, We'll sell the other car, and I was thinking, Oh, we might get Â£3,000 for it. That would be really handy. Extra little Â£3,000, oh, it'd be great. And then I said to Killy, but I don't think we should sell it. I think we should give it away. Killy goes, I know, we should give it away. And I said, I think we should give it to this guy. She goes, that's the guy we should give it to. I ring up the guy, I said, hey, do you need a car? He says, oh I'm desperate for a car. I said, well we wanna give you a car, and he's like weeping, can't believe it, and then I've asked him once or twice, how's it going? And he goes, it's changed my life. You know, and you're thinking, it's more blessed to give than to receive. Anyway, the only reason I'm telling you those stories is just to say, whether it's a coffee, whether it's to help somebody, whether it's to give something away. You know, seven years ago the Lord told me to book the Emirates Football Stadium. I said a bit more than a coffee. It was 1,200,000.0. Unknown. Unknown. But we did it. What happened on one day? Over 3,000 people received Christ in one day. So anyway, here's the point. Whether it's a coffee, rotor. Whether it's to book the Emirates Football Stadium. Anything in between. Has God asked you to do something but you haven't done it? Do it. What's the first word? Remove. What's the second word? Respond. Right? So Jesus says Lazarus, come out. Now Lazarus, he's wrapped around like, just picture it, bandages. All round, bandage, bandage, bandage completely. Jesus says Lazarus, his heart starts beating. Now you've to remember, he'd been dead for four days. Four days. You know how sometimes you cross your legs and they've been crossed for a while and then all of a sudden, you get that pins and needles and it's like, he'd been dead for four days. Okay, he's pretty stiff. Now why wasn't Jesus more pastoral? You could say Jesus you weren't very pastoral. No, why didn't you send the boys in? You know Peter, James and John, take him a herbal tea. Have we got any physios here? Have got any physios? Have we got any chiropractors? Could you just go in and give him a little massage? Cause four days, dead. He's been a bit stiff. No. You know, there are many many people who are always waiting for someone else to come and help them. No. Get up. Get up. Get up. Don't always wait for someone else to go into the tomb to get you up. You get up. Now when you get up, when you just try and get up there will be a quickening of your spirit by the power of the Holy Spirit and you will be renewed, you will be revived. So what happens, remember he's all bandaged up. He can't see. He can't use his hands. He can't use his feet really. And then Jesus says, untie him. Now, you get up, come out, and if you're bound, we'll untie you. So here's the question. Do you feel something is binding you? You're alive, you've connected with Jesus, but you're feeling bound. Something is just binding you. Well, that's where the church comes along. That's where the pastoral side of the church comes along and says, hey, we're gonna help take take those bindings off. We're gonna cut them off you. We're gonna help get this suppression off you, this darkness off you, release you, give you freedom. So if you feel bound today, maybe in your mind, many of us are bound in our minds. I like what it says in Romans 12 verse one and two. The transformation by the renewing of your mind. Do you know what the word transformation is in the original Greek? Metamorphosis. Metamorphosis. You look at a caterpillar, you were meant to fly. No. Yeah? You weren't meant to crawl on the floor like that. You were meant to fly and that's what he wants to do. He doesn't want us to crawl on the floor. He wants us to fly above and so the church comes along and sets us free in the name of Jesus. If you need setting free today, if you need setting free, you can be set free today. The beginning can happen. You might need a bit more help but it can begin today. Word number one: Remove. Word number two: Stop. Word number three: Please. Word number four. I know John chapter 12. Now the crowd was with Jesus when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead. Continued to spread the word. The fourth word is reveal. What's the fourth word? Reveal. Okay, let's do all four words together. Word one? Reveal. Word two? Word three? Release. Word four? Reveal. In other words, what God has done for you, tell someone. There are two reasons today why people are not yet Christians. Did you know that? Two reasons why people are not yet Christians. One, they have never met a Christian. Two, they have met a Christian. They are the two reasons. You and I can either help someone in their journey of faith or we can hinder someone in their journey of faith. We can either help them or we can hinder them. We don't want to hinder people in their journey of faith, we want to help people in their journey of faith. So wherever we go, we're carriers of the presence of Jesus. I was telling Melody in between the the two services. Some people create happiness wherever they go. And some people create happiness whenever they go. Don't be the latter. Be the former. Create happiness. Happiness wherever you go. Just create happiness. Do you know, I spoke at this meeting and after I spoke at this meeting, some people were talking to me and this girl comes up and she interrupts the conversation I'm having with these people and she goes I hated what you said. I know! And I said I'm so sorry. She says look I can tell you from experience that church ruins people's lives. I said well I'm very sorry that you feel that. I said, have you got a few minutes? And she's like, why? I said, well if you've got a few minutes, how about you and I go and have a little coffee? And she's like, I don't know. I said, well I'm not gonna wait here all day. Yes or no? She goes, yes. So we just went to a coffee shop, got the coffees. I said, why? Why are you so angry? It's like, all this stuff comes out. But you know, I'm not trying to defend. I'm not trying to I'm trying to be gracious. I'm trying to be gentle. I'm trying to just listen to this woman. You know, and I said something like, well look, isn't medicine good? Medicine is good, but have there been mistakes made in the name of medicine? Yeah, a lot of mistakes are being made in the name of medicine. Thalidomide, that was a mistake. Sometimes mistakes happen in a hospital and people die, but we don't throw out the whole of medicine because some mistakes are made. You know, I try to be gentle. Anyway, I said to her, look, that was a Monday, come and hear me Tuesday and we'll have a coffee. She came and went for coffee. Come and hear me Wednesday, Hear me and we'll go for coffee. She came and went for coffee. Come and hear me Thursday and we'll go for coffee. There's one more day, Friday. Come and hear me Friday, we'll go for coffee. Friday, she is ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven. Okay. Let me tell you the girl's name. Christine Cain. Five coffees. Five coffees. Sometimes you just gotta go the extra mile. Was I tired after I preached and talked to loads of people? I was knackered. But did I feel a prompting to take this girl for a coffee? By the way, I don't take girls for coffee. But I think I think the Lord used that situation. She's Greek, I'm Greek. There was a kind of Greek connection, but it was a God thing. It was a God thing. You know, and and and then wooing and helping. Look, tell others about Jesus. So we remove, we respond, we are released, and we reveal. That's it. Journey And of Christianity, how am I doing? Oh, flip. I'm wrapping up, I'm wrapping up, I'm wrapping up. The journey of Christianity, there's four words that involve the journey. Admit. Admit that we need Jesus. Admit that he died on the cross to make this possible, but then you commit. Like a couple do in a wedding, commit. But then you submit. You come under the reign and rule of God and then you transmit. Those are the four words that sum up the journey of faith. So if you've admitted, commit. If you've committed, submit. If you've submitted, transmit. Melody group, you're here. Great. Okay guys, if God has spoken to you today, you know that. You haven't yet begun your journey of faith, begin it today. How are gonna begin it? I'm gonna ask you to stand up in a moment if you wanna begin your journey of knowing Jesus. But for the majority of us here and for those of you that are tuned in online, I'm sorry I didn't mention you, those of you online but I'm aware of you. If if you know that you have to remove something between you and Jesus, in a moment stand up. If you know he's told you to do something but you haven't done it but you want to do it, stand up. If you feel bound in some way, stand up. And then I'm gonna pray a prayer. I'm gonna pray a prayer. I'm gonna ask you to pray that prayer and then Killy come on up. Killy's gonna pray for you. That's what we're gonna do. Just close your eyes just for a moment. Don't worry about people either side of you. Think about what you've heard and what you want to do. If you need something removing, if you need to respond, if you need releasing or you wanna begin your encounter with Jesus, stand up now. Please stand Wherever you are in this beautiful auditorium, please stand. Thank you so much. Well done, well done. Great. Anyone else want to stand? And those of you that are online, I don't know whether you're cooking lunch or whatever it is you're doing or if you're standing up, why don't you do the opposite and sit down? You know, just express your desire to do something. Okay, just before we pray, anyone else would like to say yes, please stand. Okay, would you all please stand now? Thank you. Do you know I love doing that because when those people first stood up, you know they may have looked around and thought oh there's not many people standing around me But look what's happened. Hundreds of other people are saying, we're standing with you. Okay. I'm gonna pray a prayer. I'm gonna pray this prayer phrase by phrase. I'll pray it once so you know the words. The second time I pray it, pray the prayer out loud. Those of you that stood. Now everyone here who loves Jesus, join in and reaffirm your faith and pray the prayer. Here's the prayer. Jesus, I bow before you now. Jesus, I bow before you now. I come just as I am. I come just as I am. I know I have done many things wrong. I know I have done many things wrong. And I ask you to forgive me. And I ask you to forgive me. Cleanse my life. Cleanse my life. Lord, I want everything removed between me and you. Lord, I want everything moved between me and you. I want to respond to everything you say. I want to respond to everything you say. And I want to be released from everything that's binding me. And I want to be released from everything that's binding me. Touch me by your holy spirit. Touch me by your holy spirit. Fill me with your power and presence. Fill me with your power and presence. Set me free. Set me free. In Jesus name. In Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Lord, I just thank you for my brothers and sisters who stood, Lord. Lord, thank you that you know each one of them by name. Lord, you know their hearts, you know their desires, you know exactly why they stood, and so Lord, I pray, by the power of your Holy Spirit, that you would meet each one of them in their bowl of need. Lord that they would truly know your restoring, your healing, your power within them. And Lord most of all we pray praying for your peace to rest upon them. Your presence to be close to them. And Lord your protection over each one of them. And we pray all this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I'm gonna pray one more prayer. Pastor Matt, do come up ready. One more prayer. If you're concerned about your health or you're concerned about the health of someone you love, put your hand on your heart. Lord Jesus, we're praying for ourselves and praying for the people that we're representing, that you release your healing power. Where there is any kind of sickness, disease, infection, we pray that you will flush it out of our bodies. Where there has been any kind of degeneration, we pray for regeneration and restoration. We speak health and wholeness and well-being in body, in mind and spirit. Give us today, us and the people we've just prayed for, a tangible sign of your healing. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Can I encourage you? Keep praying. Keep praying. I like the word push. P u s h. Pray until something happens. Now all those of you that prayed, you stood or echoed the prayer, yes, I want to remove something between me and Jesus. I want to respond. I want to be released. All those of you who said yes. All those of you that said I want to begin my journey with Jesus. At the end of this service, can I encourage you and I know pastor Matt will do as well? Please just go to the chapel just on my left here. Please go. Someone from the church will come. They're gonna pray for you. And they're gonna give you something, and they're just gonna encourage you in your journey of faith. What are those four words? Word number one? Word number two? Resolve. Word number three? Word number four? In the words of the prophet Nike, just do it. Come on. Let's really thank Canon Jay John for an awesome, awesome word this morning. Who's blessed by that? Isn't that brilliant? Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. But everybody who made that decision, we really want to congratulate you as Cal and JJ has pointed down to Ben and the team in the chapel. We'd love to get a Mark's gospel into your hand, pray with you, recognize the decision that you've made, and so I'd love for us as a church family. Can we congratulate everybody who stood in that moment saying yes to Jesus today? And also if you'd like some additional prayer, then please come down to the chapel, our prayer team will be there. Take your seats for a moment, church. Are not under your seats is the ability to give today. And I'm sure like me, you were impacted by some of those stories. In particular, maybe the firefighter Mitch, who felt God's calling to go from being a firefighter to step into the ministry and was umming and ahhing. It was kind of Jay John who sowed that seed, that step of obedience has seen amazing fruit. And that scripture that was alluded to is in Acts chapter twenties. Jesus' words that says it is more blessed to give than receive. And I just sense that at this moment around our giving, maybe this is something that God has asked you to do. And it's something that you can very practically, whether it be via these envelopes or the method on screen, maybe it's a journey that you're gonna begin today to begin giving. You know, the bible talks about when we put God first, that there is a blessing. God will open the windows of heaven. And so I wanna believe for that over your life. I know there's many people in this room. You've got stories to tell of God's provision and God's favor as you put him first. So what we're gonna do in a moment is just show a video on how practically to give, to set that up, to benefit from something called Gift Aid, which is a government initiative that helps to bring in 25% on top of your giving. And so please have a look to the screens, and then I'm gonna come back and pray, and we'll receive our giving. Thanks, different ways to give. If you're looking to give regularly, then the best way is to set up a standing order. You can do this by completing the form on the giving envelope or setting it up at home using the bank details provided. It's easy to get going, and there are no bank charges in the process. You can give online at any time by heading to soulchurch.com/give, where you can give a one off gift or set up a regular giving from your debit card. On or under your seat, you'll find an envelope to give by cash or check. Place it inside the envelope or fill out your details to give by card. Then place the envelope inside one of the containers that will pass by. If you've completed a standing order form, you can drop that in too. Finally, don't forget Gift Aid. Gift Aid is a UK government initiative where the tax that you have paid on your giving is returned to the church. For example, for every pound you give, the church receives Â£1.25. The first time you add Gift Aid to your giving, you will need to fill out the giving declaration on the envelope. This takes less than a minute, but it has huge benefits for our church. Thank you so much for your giving. Yeah. Why don't you take hold of your giving or if you're doing that online? Let's pray together. I don't want to wish away this moment as just another thing in our service. I'm going to believe right now for blessing and favor over you as you give and put God first. And so come on, let's join together as a family. Father, we wanna recognize you're our source. You're our supply. Your your your your name in the in the scriptures is Jehovah Jireh, the god who provides. And you see every person in this place. Lord, faithfully pulling you first or maybe about to begin that journey today. Lord, I pray you would give them the confidence to put their trust in you in this so practical way. God, would you open the windows of heaven over your church, over businesses, families, all different kinds of endeavors that are represented here. Lord, I pray your blessing right now in Jesus name. Amen? Amen. Wonderful. Thank you. Susan and the team who are going to receive that offering and now, we want to tell you a little bit about our SLA, our Soul Leadership Academy because we've got a new intake approaching and so, you're going to look to the screens again in just a moment. We're just going to dim the lights a little bit so you can continue to give And then right after that, Aidy's gonna come up and tell you a little bit about SLA in the future. Thanks, team. K. Let's do this. Question one, what is your dream? That's a great question. Oh. My dream is to To be a missionary and to travel the world. My dream is to see everyone happy. I don't know. Maybe something would create it. To have all my family love Jesus. We all have a dream even if it's buried, even if we don't know how to say it out loud just yet. But dreams don't grow by accident. They grow in practice, in presence, in the quiet moments of becoming. At Soul Leadership Academy, we believe in building people, not just for the platform, but for life. In the word, in the work, in the stretch. Some days it looks like theology lectures, the kind that make you see scripture differently. Other days, serving behind the scenes, learning to lead by showing up. And then there are days where you're in another nation, loving people you never forget. Days where you realize the dream never was just about you. We don't just hand out certificates here. We shape character. We grow faith. We build leaders from the inside out. So if you've got a dream, even a half formed, not sure yet, could this really be me kind of dream, maybe this is the year it begins to grow. Because when you give God your yes, nothing is impossible. Awesome. Well, my name is Adeev. We've never met before, and one of the many hats I wear at church is looking after our Soul Leadership Academy. And so I get to experience firsthand the transformational power of this program. And so I'm so excited to be launching SLA, the new intake of the twenty five, twenty six year. And so, man, I mean, that that video is pretty inspirational and shows you a little bit about what the program is. But in a nutshell, our program is a nine month experience and worked into that program is hands on ministry experience. You get to be a part of church and the ins and outs of that as well as that. We also have a a sorry. I just blanked. My whole brain just went somewhere else for a moment. I'm back. I'm back. We also have a theology course that we partner with an amazing college, and they're called Morlands College. And so they're down in Bournemouth, and we deliver their their course alongside some of our amazing lecturers, like the likes of Steve Morstan and Gemma Neal and Sarah Smith's involved as well. Just some some real buffets that get to teach these young people. As well as that, we also go on a missions trip every year. And so last year, we actually went or this year rather, we went to visit Wototo in Uganda. And so it was a really special time, and you saw some of the footage there. There's a lot of information around the course and what it is and and and what it entails. And so to make things easy this year, we've actually printed out these prospectuses and what they have inside of them is all about the course, all about what it is, all about the different theology lectures and things that that take place, where you can serve. Pretty much everything that you can think of is in here. And as well as that, we've also printed these which we'll give you out give out to at the door. It's got a little QR code on it, and that will point you towards the website, which again is filled with information. So maybe you were watching the video and you thought, man, I'm really inspired to be a part of that. That's something I wanna do. I wanna encourage you. Head head to our website or alternatively this Sunday, just outside at the front door. I'm gonna be there with some of the students in the team, and you can ask us whatever questions. We'd love to chat to you a bit about it and hand you one of these. And so it's gonna be absolutely amazing. That program is for 18 to 25 year olds, and it does have a a a midweek commitment to it. So maybe some of you are sitting, sitting in the auditorium today watching that program going, wow. I wanna learn about the bible. I wanna serve in church. I wanna do all sorts of different things. Can I just encourage you that you don't have to miss out because we have an amazing church that believes in discipleship, believes in going deeper in the word? And so on Thursday nights, we have soul central. And that's the space for us to go deeper in the word together. There's even a leadership course that's now worked into that, and so you don't have to feel like you're missing out. There's something for everyone at church, but please make sure you come and visit us if you or someone you know is interested in SLA. Finally, just before I hand over to Matt, we actually have a bunch of applications that have come through already from people overseas. We've got four people from America who are wanting to come over and do the program with us. We've got someone from Scotland. We've got a couple people from other places in The UK. And so what that means is we need to provide some accommodation. And so if you feel in your heart that you wanna be generous and open up your home and become a host home for one of these students this year, please can you come and find me at the end of the service just at the desk. I'd love to chat with you. Alternatively, if you just email us at info at soul church, you'll be put in touch with me and we can talk a little bit more about what that means. And so I just wanna encourage you to reach out because it's really gonna help us to make sure that these guys have an awesome home away from home, a family away from family, and so that would be very helpful as well. So looking forward to receiving a bunch of applications. We actually received four after the first service, so I'm excited to to receive some more and see what God does in the lives of all the students. Matt, over to you. Come on. Let's give it up for AD and the whole team. Mim, Daniella, Sarah Smith, one of our boffins. I love that. They're doing an incredible job, believing to see a great influx of students. A couple more things we wanna let you know about before I'm gonna pray and send you out into 23 degree weather. How about that? That's pretty nice, isn't it? Melody, come on forward because our sisters are gathering in a few weeks. Yes. That's right. How we doing, church? Are we good? Alright. Where's all of our soul sisters in the room? Yes. Whoop whoop. So as Matt said, we have our soul sisters evening next 5PM, which is on the June 1. And I wanna encourage you, each and every one of you, grab, your mothers, your sisters, your friends, bring your your coworkers, people from school or uni, because this is an incredible opportunity for us to gather together, as sisters in Christ. And we we have a a special guest, pastor Lori Champion, who is coming all the way from Celebration Church in in Texas, which is gonna be incredible. I hear that there's rumors we may have a banquet table again, a Grays table with some delicious food. Who loves a Grey's table? A charcuterie board. I do. But, yeah, bring your sisters. Bring your friends. It's gonna be a good night. I'm looking forward to it. Awesome, Mel. So June 1 for the ladies, and the May 21 is our man versus food evening. Anybody up for that so across the city various different restaurants the May 21 in the evening you can see all of that on the website that is also the evening in fact that man united are going win the Europa League final so that is going to be a wonderful evening in which we're going to be celebrating. Some of you are shaking your heads. Okay. Alright. Why don't you stand to your feet? I'm going to pray for all of you. As you head on out in faith after what's been an awesome service. Just lastly, on football, I know we've celebrated our sole strikers, our soul FC team, the lads are playing in a final this Saturday at the Nest at 3PM and so if you want to go out for the afternoon and go and support Justin and the team that they they've got a final this coming Saturday. So, it's good to see. It's good to see that so much happening in church life, all different ages and communities. So, let me pray for you. Do you wanna raise your hands? Come on. Why don't you receive all that god has done, all that god has spoken today? Heavenly father, thank you. We're full of gratitude, lord, to come into your house, to receive such an inspirational and impactful words from J John today. God, help it to change us. Lord, we wanna walk out lord and not just let it be something that has tickled our ears but lord, I pray that we would have the courage to pick up the phone, to have that conversation, to remove that stone, to receive all that you've done for us. And so lord, I pray a blessing over your church and everybody online. Would you bless them and keep them? Cause your face to shine on them and be gracious unto them. Lift up your continents on them and give them peace in the name of Jesus. Amen? Amen. Be blessed church. Remember to come to the chapel if you made a decision. We'll see you this week.
